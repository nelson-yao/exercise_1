The 10 measures with the highest inter-quartile range are:

measure ID	Inter Quartile Range	Measure NameED_1b	96.25	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED PatientsED_2b	63	Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted PatientsOP_18b	50	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED PatientsOP_23	29	Head CT Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 Minutes of ED ArrivalOP_2	27.5	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED ArrivalOP_3b	26	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting RateAMI_7a	23	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received within 30 Minutes of Hospital ArrivalOP_21	22	Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone FractureSTK_4	20	Thrombolytic TherapyOP_20	18	Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients



Almost all of these measures are associated with emergency departments. Therefore I concluded that the procedures with the highest variation are those that are in the emergency departments. This is a reasonable conclusion since the patients that arrive in the emergency departments have a variety of illness. The size of population in the area near each hospitals can also greatly affect wait times and transfer times in emergency departments. Therefore, quality measures in emergency departments have higher variability. 

To avoid the impact caused by outliers in quality measures, I used interquartile range for each measure instead of variances. It would be unreasonable to compare the variability scores that are skewed by a few very high or very low quality scores.
