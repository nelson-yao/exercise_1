Hospital average quality scores and HCAHPS survey responses are positively correlated. The Person correlation coefficient between average rank score of hospital and average survey rating is -0.6. Lower rank score indicates that the hospital ranks higher in terms of care quality. 

This conclusion is reasonable, since hospitals that have better quality measures than other hospitals are expected to get higher ratings from the patients. 

This approach reduced a lot of bias because, as mentioned in the answer for hospital comparison, the use of ranking scores reduces biases caused by the different scales of quality measures. Furthermore, Person correlation coefficient is the standard way of measuring correlations.
